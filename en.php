// about
"title-society"=>"Our Company",
"para-society"=>"Young Tunisian start-up, born from the meeting of students in engineering school, working to pay for their studies and a French industrialist.
The idea quickly emerged that it was interesting to offer the services of young Tunisian graduates, having in addition an experience in the industry, but also to rely on the pool of schools of technicians and engineers in order to have the resources to answer all the problems.
Internally, we do not have all the resources to meet all your demands, for example we do not have a pneumatic specialist in our team, but we have made for you the sourcing of the best specialists on the market working freelance. In this case we will be like your outsourced project manager in Tunisia.
We work seamlessly with our clients, and you will always know which part will be developed internally with us, or driven by us, with free-lance subcontractor.",
